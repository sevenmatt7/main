* This is a desktop education application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen within a Command Line
Interface (CLI).

* It is a morph of the PersonalAssistant/Duke application that was developed during Phase 1 of the project.

* It is written in OOP fashion. We used a Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for the architecture
of the whole project.
