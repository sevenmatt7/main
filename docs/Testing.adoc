== Running Tests

There are two ways to run tests.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner or Gradle in IntelliJ*

* To run all the tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run ABCCommandTest`
* Alternatively, you can `Edit Configurations` in the top right hand corner of IntelliJ and make it such that
  Gradle will run execute `test` task as shown in the screenshot below.

*Method 2: Using Gradle (on the console/terminal)*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew test`)

== Types of tests

We have three types of tests:

.  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `com.algosenpai.app.commands.parser.ParserCheckIntegerTest`
.  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (the lower level code units are assumed
    to be working). +
e.g. `com.algosenpai.app.StorageTest`
.  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as they work together to execute
    the desired action. +
e.g. `com.algosenpai.app.commands.ClearCommandTest`


== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: Running the GUI tests using Gradle (using console commands or IntelliJ) result in an error on Windows.**

* Reason: It is known that the using `TestFX 11` framework on Windows to execute the tasks in _headless_ mode will
    result in an error.
* Solution: The GUI tests need to be configured to run in _non-headless_ mode on Windows to execute and run the tests
    successfully. Therefore, comment out the portion of code in the `build.gradle` file as shown in the screenshot below.
    After this is done, run the tests again and the GUI should appear on the screen for testing. Do not move the mouse
    cursor as the tests are being executed as it might interfere with the outcome of the tests.
