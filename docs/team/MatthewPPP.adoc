== PROJECT: AlgoSenpai Adventures

== About the Project
My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line
interface desktop personal assistant application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph
it into a educational chatbot cum game named AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA) for students to learn about Data Structures and Algorithms
in a more interactive and gamified fashion. This enhanced application enables students to take quizzes on topics that they choose, earn EXP points for completing quizzes
to level up their character in the game, giving them motivation to practice more.

== Summary of contributions

This section highlights my code, documentation and other contributions to the team project.

=== Enhancements added

* Implemented and created the GUI layout.
* Implemented the EXP gain and gamification aspect of the quiz.
* Implemented the `quiz end` command to end the quiz halfway.
* Implemented the UserStats into the main application and ensuring that the .txt file is accessible in a
packaged jar file.
* Implemented the `hello` command so that the user can set up his profile and also load data from the .txt file
if he has previous data iin it.
* Implemented the `help` command.
* Wrote testcode for the setup, help, menu commands

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.3` (2 releases) on GitHub
*** Updated the GUI color scheme
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage.


** Documentation:
*** Did the layout for the documentation (User Guide and Developer Guide).

** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments)
*** Wrote a setting up and contributing guide that was used by other teams

** Tools:
*** Installed Codacy in the project repository to track code quality.
*** Installed Netlify to enable document preview when a pull request is made.


== Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

=== Provides suggestions to users to improve : `help`
This command provides a suggestion of problems that you can solve to improve at a particular chapter. +
Format : `help CHAPTER` +
Example : +
`help sorting` will list a few problems from Kattis that the user can attempt to increase their
understanding of the chapter selected.

=== Choose a chapter : `select`

This command allows you to choose the chapter of the game to be run. The CHAPTERS that are available
to be selected in the program are `Sorting`, `LinkedList` and `Bitmask`. +
Format: `select CHAPTER` +

Example : +
`select sorting` will select the chapter on Sorting for the quiz.

=== Entering a quiz answer : `quiz`
This command can only be used when you are playing the quiz itself. +
Format: `quiz ANSWER` +

Example: +
`quiz 60, 40, 30` will mean that you want to enter the answer `60, 40, 30` for the current question
in the quiz. +
`quiz 2` will mean that you want to enter the answer `2` for the current question in the quiz.

=== View all the commands available : `menu`

This command is for new users, users who are still learning the console commands, or have forgotten a particular command.
`menu` will list all the commands that are available in the program. +
Format: `menu`

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the application. Given below is a quick overview of each component.


`Main` has two classes called link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/com/algosenpai/app/Launcher.java[`Launcher`] and link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/com/algosenpai/app/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initialising the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`Ui`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor and the question generator.
* <<Design-Model,*`Stats`*>>: Holds the relevant user statistics and settings in memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `help`.

.Component interactions for `help` command

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/com/algosenpai/app/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`DialogBox`, `DialogBoxUser`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/com/algosenpai/app/ui/Ui.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]

*API* :

.  `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `Logic`.
.  The command execution will result in the `Ui` to generate a `DialogBox` on the screen.
.  The quiz is generated by the `QuizGenerator` using the `Chapter` classes in the `chapters` package.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the splash screen initially and then the main window will show with the welcome message. The window should be fixed.

. Exiting the program

.. Type `exit` into the user input box.
.. Expected: Application will shut down and close itself. +


=== Playing the quiz

. Starting and playing the quiz

.. Prerequisites: The user must not be in the quiz mode yet. Start the quiz mode using the `start` command.
.. Test case: `1` +
   Expected: The quiz will consume the user input as it will identify the input as the answer to the current question
displayed and then show the next question in the quiz.
.. Test case: `back` +
   Expected: The previous question of the current quiz will be displayed. The user can then enter the
answer to the current question.
