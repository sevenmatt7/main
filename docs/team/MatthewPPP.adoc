== PROJECT: AlgoSenpai Adventures

---

== Overview

AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA) is a desktop education/chatbot application used for teaching Data Structures and Algorithms
principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* Implemented and created the GUI layout with the colour and profile pictures and status bar layout
* Implemented the exp gain and gamification aspect of the quiz
* Implemented the userstats into the main application and ensuring that the .txt file is accessible in a
packaged jar file.
* Did the architecture for the whole project.
* Implemented the help command
* Implemented the setup process/command
* Implemented codacy.
* Implement loading of previous/saved user stats at the start of quiz
* Wrote testcode for the setup, help, menu commands

//* *Major enhancement*:  *
//** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
//** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
//** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
//** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_
//
//* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
