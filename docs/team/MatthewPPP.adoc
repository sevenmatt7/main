== PROJECT: AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA)

== About the Project
My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line
interface (CLI) desktop personal assistant application, Duke, for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph
it into a desktop Personal Teaching Assistant application instead, named AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA).
It is an application in which students can use to learn more about the topic of Data Structures and Algorithms, a topic
taught in every computer science university course. It is targeted towards NUS students who are currently taking the
module CS2040C. It can also be used by any student curious about computer science who wants to learn more about Data Structures
and Algorithms.

AlgoSenpai Adventures' teaches Data Structures and Algorithms in a more interactive and gamified fashion.
The application enables students to take quizzes on topics that they choose, earn EXP points for completing quizzes
to level up their character in the game, giving them motivation to practice more. It also has a myriad of other
features that students will find useful as they learn more about the topics included in the applicaton.

I was the team lead for this project as I was in charge of designing the architecture of the whole project and the
implementation of the various commands that are detailed below.

== Summary of contributions

* Created the codebase for the project and the various components.
* Implemented and created the GUI layout.
* Implemented the user profile creation function for the GUI.
* Implemented the UserStats into the main application and ensuring that the .txt file is accessible in a
packaged jar file.
* Implemented the setup command so that the user can set up his/her profile and also load data from the .txt file
if there was already previous data.
* Implemented the `help` command.
This command helps users by recommending them questions based on their proficiency level as determined in the application.
They will improve as they will have to apply the concepts that they have learnt in the application to solve an algorithmic problem.
* Created the QuizGenerator for the `quiz` command so that the questions can be generated for the quiz.

|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

== Introduction

AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA) is for students taking CS2040 or any similar data structures and algorithms module who
want to reinforce their understanding of the topics in a fast and engaging way, rather than through rote memorisation.
More importantly, ASA is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ASA can be a more time-efficient solution to
practice your understanding as compared to VisuAlgo (which uses clicking). Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to
get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `AlgoSenpaiAdventures.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for the application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  A `UserData.txt` file will be automatically created in the folder of the application the first
time you start it.

+

+

.  To explore the syntax of each command, simply type `menu command` and press kbd:[Enter].

+
image::menuexample.png[width="650"]
+

.  You are now ready to start your adventure. +
    Some example commands you can try:

* *`lecture`* *`sorting`* : starts a lecture on sorting.
* *`quiz`* *`linkedlist`* : starts quiz on linked lists.
* *`exit`* : exits the game.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Provides questions for improvement : `help`

This command provides a suggestion of problems (targeted at respective chapters) that you may wish to attempt to apply the
concepts you have learnt in the application to solve an algorithmic problem. The problems that are recommended are based
on your proficiency level so do not worry if you think that the questions might be too hard for you! +
Format : `help CHAPTER` +


Example : +
`help sorting` will list a few problems from Kattis that the user can attempt to increase their
understanding of the chapter selected, the problems recommended will be tailored to their level of understanding.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of AlgSenpai Adventures.
AlgoSenpai Adventures has an event-driven architecture. We used a Modified Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern
combined with the Command design pattern to create AlgoSenpai Adventures.

Given below is a quick overview of each component.


`Main` has two classes called link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/com/algosenpai/app/Launcher.java[`Launcher`]
and link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/com/algosenpai/app/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initialising the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking any cleanup methods where necessary.

`LogCenter` is a class that is used by many classes to write log messages to the application's log files. The log files
can be used during debugging to determine when and where the error occured during the running of the application.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`Ui`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor and the question generator.
* <<Design-Model,*`Stats`*>>: Holds the relevant user statistics and settings in the application.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*Class* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/com/algosenpai/app/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The *_view_* component of the Ui consists of a `MainWindow` that is composed of three parts; `DialogBox`, `DialogBoxUser` and `StatusBox`.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the
`src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the `MainWindow` is specified in link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `Ui.java` class is the controller class for the `.fxml` files. It handles any commands or input that the user has typed
on the GUI which then passes it on to the `Logic` component to be parsed and executed.

The `MusicController` class handles the playing of the background music as the application is run.

The `AnimationTimerController` class measures how much time the user is idle (e.g not typing any commands or scrolling)
as the application is run.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*Class* :
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/blob/master/src/main/java/com/algosenpai/app/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `XYZCommand` object which is executed by the `Logic`.
.  The command execution will result in the `Ui` to generate a `DialogBox` on the screen.
.  The quiz is generated by the `QuizGenerator` using the `Chapter` classes in the `chapters` package.
.  The lecture slides are generated by the `LectureGenerator` using the `Chapter` classes in the `chapters` package.



== Setting Up

== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle (The project uses JDK `11`)
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.

== Verifying the setup

. Run the `com.algosenpai.app.Launcher` and try a few commands
. <<Testing#,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

== Configurations to do before writing code

=== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`


=== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3 branding and refer to the `AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the site-wide documentation settings in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.


=== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about <<DeveloperGuide#Design-Architecture, ALgoSenpai Adventures' architecture>>.

== DevOps
== Build Automation

We use Gradle to automate builds of AlgoSenpai Adventures.

== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.

== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] and _Jacoco_ to track the code coverage of our projects.

== Documentation Previews

When a pull request has changes to the asciidoc files, https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] is used to preview the HTML version
of the modified asciidoc files.

== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in the issue tracker.
.  Generate a JAR file using Gradle by running the `gradle build` command.
.  The JAR file can then be found in the `build/libs` folder.
.  Rename the JAR file to include the version number e.g `AlgoSenpaiAdventures-v1.0`
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v1.0`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

== Managing Dependencies

Gradle downloads the dependencies automatically.

== Testing

== Running Tests

There are two ways to run tests.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner or Gradle in IntelliJ*

* To run all the tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run ABCCommandTest`
* Alternatively, you can `Edit Configurations` in the top right hand corner of IntelliJ and make it such that
Gradle will run execute `test` task as shown in the screenshot below.

image::testingscreen.png[]

*Method 2: Using Gradle (on the console/terminal)*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew test`)

== Types of tests

We have three types of tests:

.  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `com.algosenpai.app.commands.parser.ParserCheckIntegerTest`
.  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (the lower level code units are assumed
to be working). +
e.g. `com.algosenpai.app.StorageTest`
.  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as they work together to execute
the desired action. +
e.g. `com.algosenpai.app.commands.ClearCommandTest`


== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: Running the GUI tests using Gradle (using console commands or IntelliJ) result in an error on Windows.**

* Reason: It is known that the using `TestFX 11` framework on Windows to execute the tasks in _headless_ mode will
result in an error.
* Solution: The GUI tests need to be configured to run in _non-headless_ mode on Windows to execute and run the tests
successfully. Therefore, comment out the portion of code in the `build.gradle` file as shown in the screenshot below.
After this is done, run the tests again and the GUI should appear on the screen for testing. Do not move the mouse
cursor as the tests are being executed as it might interfere with the outcome of the tests.

== Documentation
== Introduction

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

== Editing Documentation

You can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

== Editing Diagrams

We used `draw.io` to create and update the UML diagrams in the developer guide. The `.drawio` files can be found
in the `docs/diagrams` folder.

== Publishing Documentation

We publish our documentation to this website https://algosenpaiadventures.netlify.com/[AlgoSenpai Adventures]
using Netlify.

== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format,
as Chrome's PDF engine preserves the hyperlinks in the documents.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Open a console and type in `gradle asciidoctor` to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format.
