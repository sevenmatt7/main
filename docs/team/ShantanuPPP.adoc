== Summary of contributions

* *Main Contribution*: Stats Component
** The Stats component allows data about the user (such as name, number of questions answered) to be stored permanently
in a text file and retrieved from storage when the program is launched again.
** It is an essential feature as it allows the user to track his/her progress over time.
** It consists of 2 main classes: The `UserStats` class that holds the data during runtime, and the `Storage` class that
handles storage to/from the text file.
** This contribution includes the description of this feature I wrote in the documentation.
