== PROJECT: AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA)
== Overview
AlgoSenpai Adventures is a desktop Personal Teaching Assistant
application. It has a GUI but most user interactions occur on CLI
(Command Line Interface). It is written in Java 11 by developers of
AY1920S1-T09-3. The application targets students taking classes in
data structures and algorithms. Students interested to reinforce their
understanding of data structures and algorithms will find this
application useful.


== Summary of contributions
* *Major enhancement*: Created functionality for users to review, archive, and
print their quizzes, mistakes, and progress.
** `print user <filename>.pdf`: Prints user's stats and learning progress.
** `print archive <filename>.pdf`: Prints archived questions.
** `print quiz <filename>.pdf`: Prints the last attempted quiz.
** `review <x>`: Reviews selected question in the last attempted quiz.
** `archive <x>`: Archives select question in the last attempted quiz.


** Justification: These features differentiate the product from other
competitors' because a user can learn from their mistakes immediately
after taking a quiz and save a record of the attempted questions for
his/her revision.
** Highlights: This feature is the final integration and depends on the
implementation on other features.The implementation was challenging due to:
*** Integration with the quizzes. For instance,
`print quiz <filename>.pdf` depends on whether a quiz has been
attempted as no quiz is recorded when the program first launches.
*** Changes in the storage. For instance, `print user <filename>.pdf`
depends on how the user information is stored in text file.


* *Minor enhancement*: Created `history` command to view list of
queries entered by the user.
* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented the music feature to play music.
* *Minor enhancement*: Created `volumne <x>` command to adjust the
volume
* *Minor enhancement*: Created a Splash Screen that launches at the
start of the application
* *Minor enhancement*: Created the `quiz <chapter name>` command
to select the chapter for the quiz.
* *Minor enhancement*: Prompts user when the application is idling.

== FAQ

*Q*: What is AlgoSenpai Adventures? +
*A*: AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA) is a desktop application to assist you in learning data structures
and algorithms. The application is not meant to replace lectures and tutorials completely. It is for
students who wants to reinforce their learning in a fun, engaging manner.

*Q*: Who is ASA for? +
*A*: ASA is intended for any students who are starting to learn data structures and algorithms.
We assumes introductory knowledge to programming in any language. The lectures provided are
in pesudocode. Students of any programming background should be able to follow the lesson.

*Q*: What topics do ASA covers? +
*A*: ASA covers chapters on Linked List, Sorting, and BitMask at the moment. We plan to
increasing the number of topics covered in future.

*Q*: How to get the most out of ASA? +
*A*: The prerequisites for using this application is introductory knowledge to programming. New users should
first attempt the lectures and quizzes built in ASA. We also have quizzes and arcade to provide you
time practices. Finally, you can save and print the questions you attempted into PDF for revision.
Besides, you can run `stats` to see your progress in the application.

*Q*: Is there a time limit to the questions given? +
*A*: There is no time limit for each question currently. We gave the users this flexibility to customize the
learning. Nevertheless, users are expected to improve with more practice.

*Q*: How to adjust the number of questions in the quiz? +
*A*: Each quiz currently is set to 10 questions. You cannot set the number of questions to attempt before the
quiz. Studies have shown that the students learned best from quizzes that are not more than 10 questions in total.

*Q*: I made an accidental mistake in my answer during the quiz. Is there a way for me to go back to the previous
question? +
*A*: No. You cannot go back to the previous. We hope to build your confidence and  accuracy when answering
questions on data structures and algorithms.

*Q*: How to download the questions? +
*A*: Run `print quiz <filename>.pdf` to print the last attempted quiz and `print archive <filename>.pdf` to
print the archived questions.

*Q*: Does my game auto-save for me or do I have to manually save it?  +
*A*: The game will try to save an instance for you automatically after certain checkpoints. However, in some
unforeseen circumstances, the program might terminate midway, causing your progress to not be saved. As such,
we recommend users to do a manual save occasionally as well.

*Q*: What is the different between the questions in quiz and arcade mode? +
*A*: Each quiz has 10 questions. You can choose the chapters you want to focus on during the quiz. In the
arcade, you can 1 question only that is random from the chapters Sorting, BitMask and LinkedList. We provide
different modes to increase the learning experience in ASA.

*Q*: Will the questions in each quiz be repeated?   +
*A*: Each question is phrased the same; however, the list of numbers provided in each question varies, and
these numbers are randomly generated. You can expect no two questions will be exactly the same so that you
can practice as many as you need.

*Q*: How can I keep a copy of a question before attempting another quiz?  +
*A*: You can run `archive <x>` where x is an integer to archive the xth question. For example, to archive question
1, you can run `archive 1`. This command is only available when you have completed a quiz.

*Q*: How can I view the archived questions? +
*A*: You cannot view the archived questions in the quiz. However, you can view the archived questions by
running `quiz archive <filename>.pdf`. This will print the archived questions into a PDF.

*Q*: How to transfer my user information into another computer? +
*A*: There is a file `UserData.txt` in the directory next to your application. This file contains your user
information. You need to transfer this file to your another computer. When you start the application, run
`load <file>.txt` to restore your information.

*Q*: How can I reset my stats?
*A*: You can run `reset` to reset you stats. Alternatively, you can delete the file `UserData.txt` in the
directory next to your application. However, information such as, your name and gender, will be lost in the
process.

*Q*: How do I maximise my learning potential with the report of my user information?   +
*A*: The report generated will give a good indication on the chapters that you are weak at, based on the time
taken to solve the questions, as well as the number of question you gotten correct. As such, more effort can be
placed into practicing the chapters which are deemed “weak” by the reports as it indicates a lack of conceptual
understanding.

*Q*: There are too many messages in the application. How do you clear the messages in the application?  +
*A*: You can run `undo <x>` where x is the number of messages you want to delete. Alternatively, you can run
`clear` to delete all the messages.

*Q*: Can I challenge friends in a multi-player mode?   +
*A*: Unfortunately, you can’t. However, you still run `print user <filename>.pdf` to print your scores and
share with your friends.

*Q*: Are there automatic software updates?    +
*A*: There is no automatic software updates. To get the updates, you need to redownload the latest version of
the software at our https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/releases[releases].

*Q*: How to get in touch? +
*A*: You can contact us at contact@algosenpaiadventures.com.

=== Print Feature
The Print Feature allows users to print his/her quiz, archived questions, or user information into a PDF to review.

`PrintCommand` class extends the `Command` abstract class, which contains an abstract method `execute` to
process the user inputs. `PrintArchiveCommand`, `PrintQuizCommand`, and `PrintUserCommand` extends the
`PrintCommand` class to process the archived questions, quiz, and user information respectively before writing the
contents to PDF. The `PrintCommand` contains the shared methods `isPdfFileExtension` and `isEmpty` to check
that the user enters a filename with the correct extension type and that the contents printed is not empty.

As shown in the diagram below, `PrintCommand`

As shown in the diagram below, group and person classes are associated. Each group contains a
UniqueList<Person>, a list of its members. Likewise, each person contains a UniqueList<Group>,
a list of all groups he is in. Due to these mutual association, commands editing/deleting
instances of group or person may have to edit the corresponding member/group lists respectively.
(Refer to DeleteGroupCommand example below.)

.Class Diagram of Group and Person
image::GroupPersonClassDiagram.png[width="400", align="center"]

`Group` features make use of `Storage` to load information on groups added by the user before the
UI is closed. `XmlAdaptedGroup` class helps the convert groups detail from xml files to the
`AddressBook` when `MainApp` starts and similarly convert `Group` objects into xml files.

`Group` features also updates the Group Panel inside the `UI` using a predicate.

==== Current Implementation
The current print commands added are:

* `print user <filename>.pdf` -- writes the user learning progress into PDF.
* `print archive <filename>.pdf` -- writes the archived questions into PDF.
* `print quiz <filename>.pdf` -- writes the quiz questions into PDF.

These functions and their parsers are handled in `Logic`, before updating `Model` and `Storage`
and displaying the updated result on the `UI`.

==== An Example: DeleteGroupCommand
The DeleteGroupCommand is a good example of how Group and Person classes are interacting
(dependent and associated with each other). An example usage scenario of how `delete_group`
behaves at each stop is explained below.
:
Step 1: The user launches the application. (We assume that the user has already added a group
and person.) `VersionedAddressBook` will be loaded with the final addressbook state before the
application was closed. Lists of groups and persons added previously will be loaded from
`addressbook.xml` file into `Model` using `XmlAdaptedPerson` and `XmlAdaptedGroup` classes.
Updated lists will be displayed in the `UI`.

.Sequence Diagram of DeleteGroupCommand (Logic component)
image::DeleteGroupCommandLogicSD.png[width="400", align="center"]

Step 2: The user enters the command `dg n/Family` to delete the existing group with group name
Family.

* The `LogicManager` class parses the command to `AddressBookParser`. `AddressBookParser`
creates a `DeleteGroupCommandParser` instance which parses the String "Family" into a `Name`
name. The parser creates a `Group` gr with the name (Family). This group is needed for the
function below.

* The parser creates a `DeleteGroupCommand` object with parameters gr. Subsequently,
`retrieveGroupFromName(m, gr.getName())` is called to the Model component in order to retrieve
the actual group with the name "Family".

.Sequence Diagram of DeleteGroupCommand (Model component)
image::DeleteGroupCommandModelSD.png[width="400", align="center"]
* After retrieving the actual group `g` with name "Family" from Model `m`, the model performs
deletion of the group using an internal function `delete(g)`.

* However, the group still has to be deleted from the groupList from all of its members.
_(Refer to GroupPersonClassDiagram above.)_ `deleteGroupFromMembers(m, g)` is called from
DeleteGroupCommand object to do so. This method calls the `UnModifiableObservableList()` method
in its UniqueList<Person> to return a list of `members` in `g`. For every `member` in the list
of `members` (for loop), `updatePersonDeleteGroupFromGroupList(m, g, member)` deletes the
reference to `g` in `member`.

* Finally, the address book is committed with all the changes.

Step 4: `FilteredPersonList` and `FilteredGroupList` is also updated correspondingly to display
the new groups and persons in the `UI`. A successful message is also displayed to the user below
the UI's command box.

Step 5: Before the application is closed, all groups and persons are stored in `addressbook.xml`
using `XmlAdaptedGroup` and `XmlAdaptedPerson` classes. _(Refer to High level sequence diagrams
Figure 3 and 4 for a similar illustration of the concept.)_

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to implement `Group` class

*Alternative 1 (current choice):* `Group` as an immutable class.

Pros: Immutable objects are good Map keys and Set elements, since these typically do not change
once created. Immutability makes it easier to write, use and reason about the code.

Cons: Doing so might restrict the way one can call the class and its methods. It may be slower
as you have to create new objects with every command.

*Alternative 2:* Setter methods for Groups

Pros: Easier and less code for methods involving groups. Faster as do not have to create new
objects each time you change a Group (e.g. edit its description or group members).

Cons: Miss out on the advantages of immutable object (above). Good practice to use immutable
objects.

===== Aspect: Interactions between person and groups

Deleting a person from a group will affect the person's reference to that group and vice versa
(similar for adding and editing).

*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Having a `UniqueList<Groups>` in `Person` and
`UniqueList<Person>` in `Group`.

Pros: Easy to retrieve groups from Person and persons from Group. Existing `UniqueList`
class available (since already used in `Model`).

Cons: Have to update both lists in most group commands (e.g. registering a new member in a group).
Issue of enforcing referential integrity - defensive programming.

*Alternative 2* Just update the list of groups in `Model` and have person refer to that list of
group as to whether it is a member of the group.

Pros: Less issues with enforcing referential integrity (see alternative 1).

Cons: Can be more expensive to look for groups for a particular person.
