== PROJECT: AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA)
== Overview
AlgoSenpai Adventures is a desktop Personal Teaching Assistant
application. It has a GUI but most user interactions occur on CLI
(Command Line Interface). It is written in Java 11 by developers of
AY1920S1-T09-3. The application targets students taking classes in
data structures and algorithms. Students interested to reinforce their
understanding of data structures and algorithms will find this
application useful.


== Summary of contributions
* *Major enhancement*: Created functionality for users to review, archive, and
print their quizzes, mistakes, and progress.
** `print user <filename>.pdf`: Prints user's stats and learning progress.
** `print archive <filename>.pdf`: Prints archived questions.
** `print quiz <filename>.pdf`: Prints the last attempted quiz.
** `review <x>`: Reviews selected question in the last attempted quiz.
** `archive <x>`: Archives select question in the last attempted quiz.


** Justification: These features differentiate the product from other
competitors' because a user can learn from their mistakes immediately
after taking a quiz and save a record of the attempted questions for
his/her revision.
** Highlights: This feature is the final integration and depends on the
implementation on other features.The implementation was challenging due to:
*** Research and implementation of print feature using
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/factory_pattern.htm[Factory Design Pattern]
to improve software design.
*** Integration with the quizzes. For instance,
`print quiz <filename>.pdf` depends on whether a quiz has been
attempted as no quiz is recorded when the program first launches.


* *Minor enhancement*: Created `history` command to view list of
queries entered by the user.
* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented the music feature to play music.
* *Minor enhancement*: Created `volumne <x>` command to adjust the
volume
* *Minor enhancement*: Created a Splash Screen that launches at the
start of the application
* *Minor enhancement*: Created the `quiz <chapter name>` command
to select the chapter for the quiz.
* *Minor enhancement*: Prompts user when the application is idling.

== FAQ

*Q*: What is AlgoSenpai Adventures? +
*A*: AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA) is a desktop application to assist you in learning data structures
and algorithms. The application is not meant to replace lectures and tutorials completely. It is for
students who wants to reinforce their learning in a fun, engaging manner.

*Q*: Who is ASA for? +
*A*: ASA is intended for any students who are starting to learn data structures and algorithms.
We assumes introductory knowledge to programming in any language. The lectures provided are
in pesudocode. Students of any programming background should be able to follow the lesson.

*Q*: What topics do ASA covers? +
*A*: ASA covers chapters on Linked List, Sorting, and BitMask at the moment. We plan to
increasing the number of topics covered in future.

*Q*: How to get the most out of ASA? +
*A*: The prerequisites for using this application is introductory knowledge to programming. New users should
first attempt the lectures and quizzes built in ASA. We also have quizzes and arcade to provide you
time practices. Finally, you can save and print the questions you attempted into PDF for revision.
Besides, you can run `stats` to see your progress in the application.

*Q*: Is there a time limit to the questions given? +
*A*: There is no time limit for each question currently. We gave the users this flexibility to customize the
learning. Nevertheless, users are expected to improve with more practice.

*Q*: How to adjust the number of questions in the quiz? +
*A*: Each quiz currently is set to 10 questions. You cannot set the number of questions to attempt before the
quiz. Studies have shown that the students learned best from quizzes that are not more than 10 questions in total.

*Q*: I made an accidental mistake in my answer during the quiz. Is there a way for me to go back to the previous
question? +
*A*: No. You cannot go back to the previous. We hope to build your confidence and  accuracy when answering
questions on data structures and algorithms.

*Q*: How to download the questions? +
*A*: Run `print quiz <filename>.pdf` to print the last attempted quiz and `print archive <filename>.pdf` to
print the archived questions.

*Q*: Does my game auto-save for me or do I have to manually save it?  +
*A*: The game will try to save an instance for you automatically after certain checkpoints. However, in some
unforeseen circumstances, the program might terminate midway, causing your progress to not be saved. As such,
we recommend users to do a manual save occasionally as well.

*Q*: What is the different between the questions in quiz and arcade mode? +
*A*: Each quiz has 10 questions. You can choose the chapters you want to focus on during the quiz. In the
arcade, you can 1 question only that is random from the chapters Sorting, BitMask and LinkedList. We provide
different modes to increase the learning experience in ASA.

*Q*: Will the questions in each quiz be repeated?   +
*A*: Each question is phrased the same; however, the list of numbers provided in each question varies, and
these numbers are randomly generated. You can expect no two questions will be exactly the same so that you
can practice as many as you need.

*Q*: How can I keep a copy of a question before attempting another quiz?  +
*A*: You can run `archive <x>` where x is an integer to archive the xth question. For example, to archive question
1, you can run `archive 1`. This command is only available when you have completed a quiz.

*Q*: How can I view the archived questions? +
*A*: You cannot view the archived questions in the quiz. However, you can view the archived questions by
running `quiz archive <filename>.pdf`. This will print the archived questions into a PDF.

*Q*: How to transfer my user information into another computer? +
*A*: There is a file `UserData.txt` in the directory next to your application. This file contains your user
information. You need to transfer this file to your another computer. When you start the application, run
`load <file>.txt` to restore your information.

*Q*: How can I reset my stats? +
*A*: You can run `reset` to reset you stats. Alternatively, you can delete the file `UserData.txt` in the
directory next to your application. However, information such as, your name and gender, will be lost in the
process.

*Q*: How do I maximise my learning potential with the report of my user information?   +
*A*: The report generated will give a good indication on the chapters that you are weak at, based on the time
taken to solve the questions, as well as the number of question you gotten correct. As such, more effort can be
placed into practicing the chapters which are deemed “weak” by the reports as it indicates a lack of conceptual
understanding.

*Q*: There are too many messages in the application. How do you clear the messages in the application?  +
*A*: You can run `delete <x>` where x is the number of messages you want to delete. Alternatively, you can run
`clear` to delete all the messages.

*Q*: Can I challenge friends in a multi-player mode?   +
*A*: Unfortunately, you can’t. However, you still run `print user <filename>.pdf` to print your scores and
share with your friends.

*Q*: Are there automatic software updates?    +
*A*: There is no automatic software updates. To get the updates, you need to redownload the latest version of
the software at our https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/releases[releases].

*Q*: How to get in touch? +
*A*: You can contact us at contact@algosenpaiadventures.com.

=== Print Feature
The print feature allows users to print his/her quiz, archived questions, or user information into a PDF.

`PrintCommand` and `PrintCommandFactory` class extends the `Command` abstract class. The abstract class contains
an abstract method `execute` to process user inputs.

`PrintArchiveCommand`, `PrintQuizCommand`, and `PrintUserCommand` extends the `PrintCommand` class. The
subclasses write the contents to PDF and return a status message. `PrintCommand` contains the methods
`isPdfFileExtension` and `isEmpty` to check the given filename has the `.pdf` file extension and the contents
to be printed is not empty.

As shown in the Class Diagram of Print Feature below, the print feature utilizes
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/factory_pattern.htm[Factory Design Pattern]. The `Logic` class
ask for a `Command` from the `PrintCommandFactory`. The `PrintCommandFactory` returns one of the following
`PrintArchiveCommand`, `PrintQuizCommand`, `PrintUserCommand`, and `PrintCommand`. Due to the navigability of
the association from `Logic` to `PrintCommandFactory`, instantiation of the `PrintCommand` and its
subclasses are not exposed to `Logic`. The output is finally passed from `PrintCommandFactory` to `Logic`.

New features to print content can be conveniently implemented by creating a subclass of `PrintCommand`
and registered in the factory class `PrintCommandFactory`.

[.center.text-center]
.Class Diagram of Print Feature

==== Current Implementation
The current print commands added are:

* `print user <filename>.pdf` -- writes the user learning progress into PDF.
* `print archive <filename>.pdf` -- writes the archived questions into PDF.
* `print quiz <filename>.pdf` -- writes the quiz questions into PDF.

The methods to parse the user input are handled in `Parser` before passing to `PrintCommandFactory`.
Depending on the second argument `user`, `archive`, or `quiz` in the user input, the data from
user information, archived questions, or the quiz is printed to PDF.

==== Example: PrintArchiveCommand
The PrintArchiveCommand demonstrates how
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/factory_pattern.htm[Factory Design Pattern]
works well in this implementation. An example of the command `print archive archive.pdf` is
described below. A Sequence Diagram PrintArchiveCommand is provided for visual representation.

Step 1: The user launches the application. First, the user runs `quiz <chapter name>` to select a
quiz chapter, then runs `start` the quiz. The user answers the 10 questions in the quiz.

Step 2: When the user finishes the quiz, if he runs `print archive archive.pdf`, no PDF is created.
Instead, a message `Nothing in archive` is displayed on the `Ui` . This is because the user has not
archived any questions yet.

Step 3: After the user runs `archive 5`, the user successfully archived the 5th question in the quiz
(the first question starts from index 1). Currently, the users has one question archived. To archived
more questions, he can run `archive <x>` where x is the xth question in the quiz.

* Inside `Logic`, the `Parser` class has a static method `parseInput` that trims spacing on the two
ends of the user inputs. It also replaces multiple spacing between words to single spacing. Finally,
the user input is split by spacing and returned as an `ArrayList<String`.

* Inside `Logic`, the `Parser` class has a static method `isInteger` that checks whether the user
entered a number that can be converted to a number. Otherwise, an error message is displayed on the
`Ui`.

.Sequence Diagram of PrintArchiveCommand
image::sequence_diagram_print_archive_command.png[width="800"]



Step 4: The user can print the archived question to PDF. Running `print archive archive.pdf` will
create with the archived contents. A wrong input will instead display an error message on the `Ui`.

* Inside `PrintArchiveCommand`, the super class `PrintCommand` has two methods `isPdfFileExtension`
and `isEmpty` to check the filename has the extension `.pdf` and the contents to be printed is not
empty.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Software design of Print Feature (How to handle different types of printing?)

*Alternative 1 (current choice):* Implement
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/factory_pattern.htm[Factory Design Pattern]
in `PrintCommandFactory` to register and implement different printing instructions.

Pros: Exposing `PrintCommandFactory` only appears to be good software practice in terms of
abstraction, software is also scalable to support new printing features by registering
the new subclasses of `PrintCommand` in `PrintCommandFactory`.

Cons: Restricted to calling the method in `PrintCommandFactory`.

*Alternative 2:* Create a new method in `Logic` to handle different printing instructions.

Pros: Easy to implement and avoid the arrowhead style code. Faster to implement because there
is no need to create a new class

Cons: Un-scalable, and the code becomes more cluttered when new printing features are introduced.

*Alternative 3:* Return in the subclasses `PrintCommand` to handle different printing instructions.

Pros: Easy to implement and and less code inside `Logic`.

Cons: Un-scalable, and is a bad design practice to return the subclass in the super class.
