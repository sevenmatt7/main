== Introduction

AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA) is for students taking CS2040 or any similar data structures and algorithms module who want to reinforce their understanding of the topics in a fast and engaging way, rather than through rote memorisation. More importantly, AB4 is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ASA can be a more time-efficient solution to practice your understanding as compared to VisuAlgo (which uses clicking). Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ASA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`menu`* : lists the menu directory
* **`select`**`3` : selects Chapter 3 to be included in th game.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== FAQ

*Q*: Does my game auto-save for me or do I have to manually save it?  +
*A*: The game will try to save an instance for you automatically after certain checkpoints. However, in some unforeseen circumstances, the program might terminate midway, causing your progress to not be saved. As such, we recommend users to do a manual save occasionally as well.

*Q*: How do I maximise my learning potential with the report that I have generated?   +
*A*: The report generated will give a good indication on the chapters that you are weak at, based on the time taken to solve the questions, as well as the number of question you gotten correct. As such, more effort can be placed into practicing the chapters which are deemed “weak” by the reports as it indicates a lack of conceptual understanding.

*Q*: Is there a time limit to the questions given? +
*A*: There is a time limit for each question, but it is gradual. Users are expected to improve with more practice and as such they should be able to answer questions within the stipulated time. Questions at the beginning are generally given more time than questions towards the ending of the chapter.

*Q*: I made an accidental mistake in my answer for the previous question. Is there a way for me to undo it? +
*A*: Yes. You can enter the command `back` to redo the last question.

*Q*: What is the difference between `undo` and `back`?  +
*A*:`undo` will reverse the decision made by the user while “-back” simply returns to the previous question. `undo` will not reverse any answer input given by the user, but rather any other console commands given.
