== Introduction

AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA) is for students taking CS2040 or any similar data structures and algorithms module who
want to reinforce their understanding of the topics in a fast and engaging way, rather than through rote memorisation.
More importantly, ASA is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ASA can be a more time-efficient solution to
practice your understanding as compared to VisuAlgo (which uses clicking). Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to
get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `AlgoSenpaiAdventures.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for the application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  A `UserData.txt` file will be automatically created in the folder of the application the first
time you start it.

+

.  To begin, just type in `hello name gender` to put in your username and gender and press kbd:[Enter] to start your adventure.

+

== FAQ

*Q*: What is AlgoSenpai Adventures? +
*A*: AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA) is a desktop application to assist you in learning data structures
and algorithms. The application is not meant to replace lectures and tutorials completely. It is for
students who wants to reinforce their learning in a fun, engaging manner.

*Q*: Who is ASA for? +
*A*: ASA is intended for any students who are starting to learn data structures and algorithms.
We assumes introductory knowledge to programming in any language. The lectures provided are
in pesudocode. Students of any programming background should be able to follow the lesson.

*Q*: What topics do ASA covers? +
*A*: ASA covers chapters on Linked List, Sorting, and BitMask at the moment. We plan to
increasing the number of topics covered in future.

*Q*: How to get the most out of ASA? +
*A*: The prerequisites for using this application is introductory knowledge to programming. New users should
first attempt the lectures and quizzes built in ASA. We also have quizzes and arcade to provide you
time practices. Finally, you can save and print the questions you attempted into PDF for revision.
Besides, you can run `stats` to see your progress in the application.

*Q*: Is there a time limit to the questions given? +
*A*: There is no time limit for each question currently. We gave the users this flexibility to customize the
learning. Nevertheless, users are expected to improve with more practice.

*Q*: How to adjust the number of questions in the quiz? +
*A*: Each quiz currently is set to 10 questions. You cannot set the number of questions to attempt before the
quiz. Studies have shown that the students learned best from quizzes that are not more than 10 questions in total.

*Q*: I made an accidental mistake in my answer during the quiz. Is there a way for me to go back to the previous
question? +
*A*: No. You cannot go back to the previous. We hope to build your confidence and  accuracy when answering
questions on data structures and algorithms.

*Q*: How to download the questions? +
*A*: Run `print quiz <filename>.pdf` to print the last attempted quiz and `print archive <filename>.pdf` to
print the archived questions.

*Q*: Does my game auto-save for me or do I have to manually save it?  +
*A*: The game will try to save an instance for you automatically after certain checkpoints. However, in some
unforeseen circumstances, the program might terminate midway, causing your progress to not be saved. As such,
we recommend users to do a manual save occasionally as well.

*Q*: What is the different between the questions in quiz and arcade mode? +
*A*: Each quiz has 10 questions. You can choose the chapters you want to focus on during the quiz. In the
arcade, you can 1 question only that is random from the chapters Sorting, BitMask and LinkedList. We provide
different modes to increase the learning experience in ASA.

*Q*: Will the questions in each quiz be repeated?   +
*A*: Each question is phrased the same; however, the list of numbers provided in each question varies, and
these numbers are randomly generated. You can expect no two questions will be exactly the same so that you
can practice as many as you need.

*Q*: How can I keep a copy of a question before attempting another quiz?  +
*A*: You can run `archive <x>` where x is an integer to archive the xth question. For example, to archive question
1, you can run `archive 1`. This command is only available when you have completed a quiz.

*A*: You cannot view the archived questions in the quiz. However, you can view the archived questions by
running `quiz archive <filename>.pdf`. This will print the archived questions into a PDF.

*Q*: How to transfer my user information into another computer? +
*A*: There is a file `UserData.txt` in the directory next to your application. This file contains your user
information. You need to transfer this file to your another computer. When you start the application, run
`load <file>.txt` to restore your information.

*Q*: How can I reset my stats?
*A*: You can run `reset` to reset you stats. Alternatively, you can delete the file `UserData.txt` in the
directory next to your application. However, information such as, your name and gender, will be lost in the
process.

*Q*: How do I maximise my learning potential with the report of my user information?   +
*A*: The report generated will give a good indication on the chapters that you are weak at, based on the time
taken to solve the questions, as well as the number of question you gotten correct. As such, more effort can be
placed into practicing the chapters which are deemed “weak” by the reports as it indicates a lack of conceptual
understanding.

*Q*: There are too many messages in the application. How do you clear the messages in the application?  +
*A*: You can run `undo <x>` where x is the number of messages you want to delete. Alternatively, you can run
`clear` to delete all the messages.

*A*: Unfortunately, you can’t. However, you still run `print user <filename>.pdf` to print your scores and
share with your friends.

*Q*: Are there automatic software updates?    +
*A*: There is no automatic software updates. To get the updates, you need to redownload the latest version of
the software at our https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2113T-T09-3/main/releases[releases].
