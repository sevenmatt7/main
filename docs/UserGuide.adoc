== Introduction

AlgoSenpai Adventures (ASA) is for students taking CS2040 or any similar data structures and algorithms module who
want to reinforce their understanding of the topics in a fast and engaging way, rather than through rote memorisation.
More importantly, AB4 is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ASA can be a more time-efficient solution to
practice your understanding as compared to VisuAlgo (which uses clicking). Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to
get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `AlgoSenpaiAdventures.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for the application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  A `UserData.txt` file will be automatically created in the folder of the application the first
time you start it.

   e.g. typing *`menu`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will list out all the commands that are recognised in the
   program.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`menu`* : lists all the commands supported in the program.
* **`select`**`linkedlist` : selects Chapter 2 (Linked List) to be included in the game.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

====

=== View all the commands available : `menu`

This command is for new users, users who are still learning the console commands, or have forgotten a particular command.
`menu` will list all the commands that are available in the program. +
Format: `menu`

=== Start the quiz : `quiz`
This command allows you to start the quiz. You will need to specify which Chapter you want to play using the `select`
command first. If not, you will be prompted to do so by the program. +
Format: `quiz`

=== Entering a quiz answer : `quiz`
This command can only be used when you are playing the quiz itself. +
Format: `quiz ANSWER` +

Example: +
`quiz 60, 40, 30` will mean that you want to enter the answer `60, 40, 30` for the current question
in the quiz. +
`quiz 2` will mean that you want to enter the answer `2` for the current question in the quiz.

=== Choose a chapter : `select`

This command allows you to choose the chapter of the game to be run. The CHAPTERS that are available
to be selected in the program are `Sorting`, `LinkedList` and `Bitmask`. +
Format: `select CHAPTER` +

Example : +
`select sorting` will select the chapter on Sorting for the quiz.

=== List results of a chapter : `result`

This command will generate a comprehensive summary of the previous quiz that you attempted. You will be able to see
where you went wrong in your previous quiz so you can improve in your next attempt. +
Format : `result`

=== Generate an overall report : `report` `[coming in v1.4]`

This command provides a comprehensive summary of results for all the chapters. You can expect to see which chapters you
need to improve on, and which chapters are good enough from the comments given. +
Format : `report`

=== Return to the previous question : `back`

This command allows users to return to the last question if you made a mistake. This would help prevent any accidental input,
rendering the answer as wrong. +
Format : `back`

=== List previously entered commands : `history`

This command provides a list of commands you have entered. This would be useful in the event if some console command has changed
the your result but you has forgotten what commands you have entered. +
Format : `history NUMBER` +
Example : +
`history 5` will print the last 5 console commands given.

=== Undo a console command : `undo`

This command provides a way for you to undo an accidental wrong command. This is mainly for inexperienced users who are not yet
familiar with the results of the numerous commands. +
Format : `undo`

=== Clear results of a chapter : `clear` `[coming in v1.4]`

This command removes all existing results on a particular chapter. This feature is for users who wish to see how have they
improved in comparison to the previous round. +
Format : `clear CHAPTER` +
Example : +
`clear 1` will print the results of the Sorting chapter.

=== Reset the whole game : `reset` `[coming in v1.4]`

This command provides a way for you to restart the entire game by clearing all progress and results. This is for users who
wish to repeat the game after clearing all the stages. +
Format : `reset`

=== Manually save the game : `save` `[coming in v1.4]`

This command provides a way for you to save the game manually. Normally, the game would already be saving your game for you at
certain checkpoints. However, in the event that our auto-save function does not work, it is highly recommended to do a manual save
from time to time. +
Format : `save`

=== Provides suggestions to users to improve : `help`

This command provides a suggestion of problems that you can solve to improve at a particular chapter. +
Format : `help CHAPTER` +
Example : +
`help sorting` will list a few problems from Kattis that the user can attempt to increase their
understanding of the chapter selected.

=== Exits the game : `exit`

This command provides a way for you to terminate the game. +
Format : `exit`

=== Change the volume of the background music : `volume VALUE`

//TODO by BRANDON

=== Print questions : `print` `[coming in v2.0]`

This command provides a way for you to print the questions you have experienced in a text file. This is for users who
want to keep a copy of the questions they found hard, or attempted wrongly. +
Format : `print`

=== Archive questions : `archive` `[coming in v2.0]`

This command archives the current question. This is for users who found a particular question interesting, or users who are
not sure of the correct answer and wish to review the question in greater detail in the future. +
Format: `archive`

== FAQ

*Q*: Does my game auto-save for me or do I have to manually save it?  +
*A*: The game will try to save an instance for you automatically after certain checkpoints. However, in some unforeseen circumstances, the program might terminate midway, causing your progress to not be saved. As such, we recommend users to do a manual save occasionally as well.

*Q*: How do I maximise my learning potential with the report that I have generated?   +
*A*: The report generated will give a good indication on the chapters that you are weak at, based on the time taken to solve the questions, as well as the number of question you gotten correct. As such, more effort can be placed into practicing the chapters which are deemed “weak” by the reports as it indicates a lack of conceptual understanding.

*Q*: Is there a time limit to the questions given? +
*A*: There is a time limit for each question, but it is gradual. Users are expected to improve with more practice and as such they should be able to answer questions within the stipulated time. Questions at the beginning are generally given more time than questions towards the ending of the chapter.

*Q*: I made an accidental mistake in my answer for the previous question. Is there a way for me to undo it? +
*A*: Yes. You can enter the command `back` to redo the last question.

*Q*: What is the difference between `undo` and `back`?  +
*A*:`undo` will reverse the decision made by the user while `back` simply returns to the previous question. `undo` will not reverse any answer input given by the user, but rather any other console commands given.

*Q*: How can I keep a copy of the questions?  +
*A*: You can either archive the questions in the game with the command `archive` or print the questions into PDF with the command `print`. 

*Q*: Will the questions in each quiz be repeated?   +
*A*: Each question will be phrased the same; however, the list of numbers for the question are randomly generated.

*Q*: Can I challenge friends in a multiplayer mode?   +
*A*: Unfortunately, you can’t. However, you still can share your scores with your friends through email.

*Q*: Are there automatic software updates?    +
*A*: There is no automatic software updates. To get the updates, you need to redownload the latest version of the software.
